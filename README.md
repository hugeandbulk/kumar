Does UTF-8 have a BOM?

The UTF-8 BOM is a sequence of bytes at the start of a text stream ( 0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF ) that allows the reader to more reliably guess a file as being encoded in UTF-8. Normally, the BOM is used to signal the endianness of an encoding, but since endianness is irrelevant to UTF-8, the BOM is unnecessary.

What is BOM code in UTF-16?

U+FEFF

Unicode in the 16-bit UTF-16 form has no prescribed endian orientation for interchange. This requires communication processes to evaluate the endian orientation correctly. To aid in this, the character U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE can be used as a Byte Order Mark (BOM).

What is CSS object-position?

The object-position CSS property specifies the alignment of the selected replaced element's contents within the element's box. Areas of the box which aren't covered by the replaced element's object will show the element's background.

What is the difference between DOM and Cssom?

The DOM contains all the information about the relationships of the HTML element of the page, while the CSSOM contains the information about how to style the elements. The Render Tree contains information about all visible DOM content on the page and all necessary CSSOM information for the different nodes.
